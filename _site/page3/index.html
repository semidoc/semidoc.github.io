        Greedy algorithm for maximum independent set

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2018</span>

    <p>One more post of our GT CoA series. The introductory post is 
<a href="https://semidoc.github.io/information-communication">here</a>. 
We skip the third talk, <em>Lempel-Ziv: a “one-bit catastrophe” but not a tragedy</em> 
because we have already covered this paper, see 
<a href="https://semidoc.github.io/lagarde-catastrophe">this post</a>. The fourth talk of 
the meeting was about greedy algorithms for maximum independent set, presented 
by <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~mmari/index.html">Mathieu Mari</a>. Once again, the text 
will not deal much with the actual  work of the speaker, but more with the 
background of it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="maximum-independent-sets-are-hard-to-find">Maximum independent sets are hard to find</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)">Maximum independent set</a> 
is an algorithmic problem, which asks to find the maximum set of nodes of the 
input graph such that not two nodes of the set are adjacent. As the problem is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">NP-hard</a>, one naturally look for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm">approximation algorithms</a>. 
Unfortunately it is impossible to design a non-trivial polynomial-time 
approximation algorithm, unless you know what happens<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these hardness results are for worst-case general graphs, and 
it is still interesting to study the behaviour of very simple algorithms. 
This post is about greedy algorithms.</p>

<h2 id="a-greedy-algorithm-and-when-it-fails">A greedy algorithm and when it fails</h2>
<p>A greedy algorithm for maximum independent set is the following:</p>

<p>Start with all nodes unlabelled.<br />
Until all nodes are labelled:<br />
    Choose an unlabelled node with the minimum of unlabelled neighbours; <br />
    Label this node with 1, and its unlabelled neighbours with 0; <br />
Output the set of nodes labelled with 1.</p>

<p>The idea of choosing a node whose degree in the remaining unlabelled part of the 
graph comes 
from a simple intuition: if I choose a node with high degree, I will label 
a lot of nodes in one step, which is bad because it decreases a lot the 
number of nodes that are candidates to be in the independent set. But because of 
what we said before, we know that this has to fail sometimes. Here is an example. 
There are three sets of nodes : ${x}$, ${a_1,…., a_k}$ and 
${b_1,…,b_k}$. The vertex $x$ is linked to every $a_i$, every 
$a_i$ is linked to every $b_j$, and the $b_j$ form a clique. On this graph, the 
algorithm will first pick $x$, and then pick a node 
in ${b_1,…,b_k}$, and stop. The independent set returned has size 2, but 
${a_1,…., a_k}$ is an independent set of size $k$, therefore the approximation 
ratio is roughly the size of the instance.</p>

<h2 id="and-when-it-succeeds">And when it succeeds</h2>
<p>The first thing one can say about this graph, is that it uses very high degree 
nodes. What happens if we consider bounded degree graphs? Then for maximum degree 
$\Delta$, greedy achieves the approximation of ratio $\frac{\Delta+2}{3}$<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, 
which is not that bad. 
A second thing one can say, is that this graph does not seem generic, for example 
it does not look like a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model">random graph</a>. 
And greedy is quite good on random graphs 
actually, it achieves a ratio 2 in expectation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Random graph are not that common in applications though, either on real-world 
graphs or on network architecture. What about trees, what about planar graphs? 
Once again greedy is a good choice: it provides a 6-approximation on planar 
graphs, and is optimal for trees.</p>

<p>There is a general method to prove that greedy is optimal for 
trees, and also on other graph classes, such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outerplanar_graph">maximal outerplanar graphs</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cograph">cographs</a>, and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_graph">split graphs</a>. 
First note that if there is a node $v$ in the graph 
such that its neighbours and itself form a clique, then this node belongs to one of 
the maximum independent sets. Indeed only one node from the clique can be in the 
set, and we can always take the node $v$, because there cannot be a conflict 
with a node outside the clique. If the class of graphs at hand has the property 
that the nodes with the lowest degree have such clique neighbourhoods, then the 
greedy algorithm never makes a bad choice, and is optimal. In trees, the lowest 
degree nodes are the leaves, and they have such a property, because they have 
only one neighbour, thus the greedy algorithm is optimal.</p>

<h2 id="how-good-is-greedy-on-a-particular-graph">How good is greedy on a particular graph?</h2>
<p>Ok, so greedy can be very bad, but it can also be good. And this can depend not 
only on the graph but also on the choices made by the algorithm : at every step 
there can be several nodes with minimum degree, and the choice can dramatically 
change the output. But can we predict how good or bad greedy can be? Can we 
know which execution of the algorithm will give the best outcome, without 
running it ? Mathieu and his co-author’s answer is basically “no”.</p>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Some precisions about the non-approximability results. The precise results is that it is NP-hard to get a $n^{1-\epsilon}$ approximation of the maximum independent set. It comes from the paper <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5be6/a7e25c5e4cb0f1ece182042dc6275e438bbd.pdf">Clique is hard to approximate within $n^{1–\epsilon}$</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_H%C3%A5stad">Johan Håstad</a> and is proved with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem">PCP machinery</a>. Note that the title of the paper is about the maximum clique problem and not the independent set, but for general graphs this is the same problem: just take the complement of the input graph.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
