  <h1 class="post-title">Introduction to Mealy automata, Grigorchuk group and the Burnside problem</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2018</span>
  <p>Hello! After a quite long pause, semidoc comes back, with the long-awaited post by 
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/~godin/">Thibault Godin</a> about his research. Thibault is 
currently postdoc in Turku, Finland, but was PhD student when he gave a talk at 
the PhD seminar. 
After this post, 
<a href="https://vlanvin.fr/">Victor Lanvin</a> replaces 
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/~feuilloley/index_en.html">me</a> as ``maintainer’’ of this 
blog. Enjoy!</p>

<hr />

<p>During my PhD, I have been mostly looking at drawings like this one:</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-1.png" alt="" class="center-image" height="400px" /></p>

<p>Theses drawings are called <strong>Mealy automata</strong>, and in this note we will see how 
they can be used to solve important problems arising from group theory. 
More precisely we aim to prove that the group generated by the automaton above solves 
Burnside Problem, <em>i.e.</em> is on the edge between finite and infinite groups. 
We will first explain how this automaton can represent a <strong>group</strong>, then why is 
this group <strong>infinite</strong> and finally why are every elements of this group of 
<strong>finite order</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="mealy-automata-and-groups">Mealy automata and groups</h2>

<p>We see that the  graph of the first figure has vertices labelled by letters and 
edges (called transitions) of the form $x|y$ with $x,y \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$. 
We are going to call $a,b,c,d,e$ the <em>states</em> of the automaton,  $\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$ 
its <em>alphabet</em>, $x$ the <em>input</em> letter of the transition, and $y$ the <em>output</em> 
letter of the transition.</p>

<p>As for a classical automaton, the main move is, from a state, to read a letter. 
For instance reading $0$ from the state $b$ leads us to $a$ outputting $0$, 
because the transition is $b \xrightarrow{ 0\mid  0} a $. 
This action can be easily extended, and from a state we can read a word of letter. 
For instance if we want to read, from the state $b$, the word $0100$, we start 
as before by following the transition $b \xrightarrow{ 0\mid  0} a $, outputting $0$. 
What left to do is to read the word $100$, now from $a$, so we follow the 
transition $a \xrightarrow{ 1\mid  0} e $, and we iterate this process until 
there is no more letter to be read. 
To summarise we have went through the states $b,a,e$ and $e$, outputting $0000$. 
This can be read as a path in the automaton:</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-2.png" alt="" class="center-image" height="50px" /></p>

<p>or equivalently</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-3.png" alt="" class="center-image" height="130px" /></p>

<p>As we see, $b$ transforms $0100$ into $0000$. As we can do this for any word, 
we can say that $b$ induces a transformation $\rho_b$ from $ \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace^* $ 
to itself. 
Hence we get one function from word to word per state. 
Moreover, since these functions have the same domain and codomain, we can 
<em>compose</em> them as we want. 
Note that the composition corresponds in the automaton to the plug-in of the 
output of a run to the input of another. 
Namely $\rho_{ab} = \rho_b \circ \rho_a$ can be seen as</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-4.png" alt="" class="center-image" height="230px" /></p>

<p>This structure where object can be compose together is called a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup">semigroup</a>. 
The most well known semigroup is certainly the set of positive integer 
(because the addition of two such number is always a positive integer), 
but in computer science we also use quite often the semigroup of words 
(the concatenation of two words is also a word), and we can think to many 
other examples. 
The theory of semigroups is a wide area intertangling math and informatics, 
but one is generally more familiar with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">group theory</a>, where the 
elements can always be inversed.</p>

<p>In our setting, generating a group means that each function has to be bijective, 
<em>i.e.</em>  that every state induces a function that can be inverted.</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-5.png" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>This can be easily verified on the automaton: it is equivalent to require that 
every state induces a permutation on the alphabet. 
This is the case for the Grigorchuk automaton (for instance $a$ flips $0$ and $1$), 
so we can study the <em>group generated by the Grigorchuk automaton</em>, 
henceforth called the <em>Grigorchuk group</em>.</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-6.png" alt="" class="center-image" height="300px" /></p>

<h2 id="infiniteness-of-the-grigorchuk-group">Infiniteness of the Grigorchuk group</h2>

<p>For the <strong>Grigorchuk group</strong>  lots of properties are known. 
For instance we can prove that it <strong>infinite</strong> :</p>

<p>First, we can see that $e = \mathbb{1}_{\Sigma^*}$ because $e$ is a sink state 
which copies the input word on the output.</p>

<p>We are going to construct an infinite number of elements via a morphism~$\eta$ 
defined by:</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-7.png" alt="" class="center-image" height="300px" /></p>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>
The elements $\eta^{\ell}(a)$ are pairwise different in the Grigorchuk group.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>
We show that the $\eta^{\ell}(a)$  act differently on $1^\omega$. We have:</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-8.png" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>So, as $e$ acts like the identity in the group, it can be ignored when it 
appears in a word, we have:</p>

<p><img src="assets/godin-mealy-9.png" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>hence every $\eta^\ell(a)$ acts differently on $1^\omega$, so they represent 
different elements in the group.</p>

<p>We have proved:</p>

<p><strong>Corollary:</strong> The Grigorchuk group is infinite</p>

<h2 id="the-burnside-problem">The Burnside Problem</h2>

<p>Now, why would one wants to study such groups? 
Because it is an <strong>infinite Burnside group</strong>. Let’s elaborate:</p>

<p>the <strong>order</strong> of a element $g$ is the smallest positive integer~$n$ such that 
$g^n$ is the identity in the group. 
When such an integer exists we say that $g$ has <strong>finite order</strong>, infinite otherwise.</p>

<p>For instance in $(\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z},+)$, $5$ has order $12$ because $5+5=10$, $10+5 = 3$, 
$3+5=8$, $8+5=1$, $1+5=6$, $6+5=11$, $11+5 = 4$, $4+5 = 9$, $9+5=2$, $2+5=7$, 
$7+5=0=e$. In the same fashion $2$ has order 6 and $8$ has order $3$.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for the group of integers $\mathbb{Z}$, zero is the only element of 
finite order since the repeated sum of the same integer goes to plus or minus infinity.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that if a group has an element of infinite order (and hence 
contains a copy of $\mathbb{Z}$ has a subgroup), then it has to be infinite 
(if $g$ has infinite order, then $\lbrace g^k, k \in \mathbb{Z} \rbrace$ is infinite). 
The reciprocal gives that a finite group has only elements of finite order.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the XX${}^{th}$ century, people only knew finite groups and infinite 
groups with elements of infinite order.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> 
Hence the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside_problem">question of Burnside</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Question, Burnside (1902):</strong>
Can a finitely generated group have all elements of finite order  and be  infinite?</p>

<p>This question became central in group theory and was solved for several classes 
of groups (for instance it is not hard to see that when the group is commutative 
the answer is no).</p>

<p>The solution was found in 1964 by Golod and Shafarevich, who gave an explicit 
example of  a finitely generated group with all elements of finite order  and 
 infinite (henceforth called <strong>infinite Burnside group</strong>. 
However this example is very complicated and requires deep results in field theory, 
and, as  these groups are on the edge between finiteness and infiniteness, 
people continued to look for examples.</p>

<p>We are now going to prove that the group generated by the Grigorchuk automaton 
is an infinite Burnside group.</p>

<p>One of the crucial observation for our proof is that the subgroup generated by 
$b,c,d$ is finite: 
$\langle b,c,d \rangle = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. 
The relations are:</p>

<p>$bc=cb=d ~;~ bd=db=c ~;~ cd=dc= b.$</p>

<p>The proof is a simple verification and can be done with cross diagrams or via 
computer assisted computations.</p>

<p>Let us recall that the <em>conjugate</em> of $g$ by $h$ is the group element $h^{-1}gh$.
We need the small lemma:</p>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>
If $g$ has finite order $n$, then so does each of its conjugates.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> We compute:</p>

<p>$(h^{-1}gh)^n = h^{-1}ghh^{-1}gh … h^{-1}gh  = h^{-1}g^nh =h^{-1}e h = e$.</p>

<p>So $h^{-1}gh$ has order less than $n$, we get the other inequality by symmetry: 
$g$ is conjugate to $h^{-1}gh$ by $h^{-1}$.</p>

<p>We now have all the tools we need to prove</p>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> The group $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle$ has every element of finite order.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Let $g \in \langle\mathcal{G}\rangle$. We are going to do an induction 
on the length of the shortest representative of $g$ on $Q^*$. 
Let $\ell$ be this shortest length and  $\mathbf{w}$ be a word on $Q$ of length 
$\ell$ representing $g$ in $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle$. 
As the product of two element of $S := Q \setminus \lbrace  a \rbrace$ is an 
element of  $S$, we can assume that $\mathbf{w}$ is written as an 
alternation of an $a$ and a letter of $S$. 
One can show<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> for initialisation, that if 
$\ell &lt; 3$, then $g$ has finite order.</p>

<p>Assume $\ell$ is <em>odd</em>. If $\mathbf{w}$ starts with an $a$, then 
$\mathbf{w}= a\mathbf{u}a = {\mathbf{u}}^{a}$ (since $a^{-1}=a$), with 
$\mathbf{u}$ a word on $Q$ of length $\ell - 2$. 
Hence we can use the induction of $u$, and since conjugation does not change 
the order (Lemma above), $g$ has finite order.
If $\mathbf{w}$ starts with $p \in S$, then $\mathbf{w}  = p\mathbf{u}q$, $q\in S$. 
We can conjugate  by  $p^{-1}$ : ${g}^{p^{-1}} = p^{-1}p \mathbf{u} q p$. 
The word $\mathbf{u}r$ has length at most $\ell -1$ 
(since  $q.p = r \in S$), whence the order of $g$ (which is equal 
to the order of $\mathbf{u}r$) is finite order using the induction hypothesis.</p>

<p>Now is $\ell$ is <em>even</em>. 
By conjugation we can assume that $\mathbf{w}$ starts with an $a$. 
We are going to split the analysis into sub-cases depending on the length of 
$\mathbf{w}$.
If $4$ divides $\ell$, then 
$\mathbf{w} = a w_1 a u_1 a w_2 a … a w_{\ell/4} a u_{\ell /4} $ and we can 
group the letters of $w$ into blocks $a w_i a$ and $w_j$. 
As $\mathbf{w}$ has an even number of $a$, $\mathbf{w}$, can be decomposed as 
$ (\mathbf{w_{ 0}},\mathbf{w_{ 1}})()$<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
where $\mathbf{w_\epsilon}$ ($\epsilon \in \lbrace   0,  1 \rbrace$) have length 
at most $\ell/2$, since blocks $aw_ia$ can be decomposed as $aw_ia = (s,t)$ 
with $s,t \in Q$. 
So, the order of $g$ is the lowest common multiple of the orders of 
$\mathbf{w_\epsilon}$, finite by the induction.
Finally, if $\ell= 4j-2$, we consider $g^2$, represented by $\mathbf{ww}$.</p>

<ul>
  <li>if $\mathbf{w}$ contains a letter $d$,  then the length of $(w_{\epsilon})$ 
is lesser or equal to $ 4j-3$ and we can conclude.</li>
  <li>if $\mathbf{w}$contains a letter $  c$ then the words $\mathbf{w_{\epsilon}}$ 
are either of size lesser or equal to $4j-3$,  or contain a $d$, and we conclude 
using the previous case on $\mathbf{w_\epsilon}$.</li>
  <li>otherwise, the word $\mathbf{w}$ is a power $ab$, hence of finite order.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the corollary above, we get:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> The group $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle$  generated by the Grigorchuk
 automaton $\mathcal{G}$ is an infinite Burnside group.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Among the interests of this proof are its shortness and elementariness: we have 
not used any theorem  that goes further a first lecture in group theory.</p>

<p>Moreover, these groups generated by Mealy automata have given several other 
interesting examples, among which are the first groups with 
<a href="Growth_rate_(group_theory)">intermediate growth</a> (solving <strong>Milnor Problem</strong>), 
non uniform exponential growth (solving <strong>Gromov Problem</strong>), or 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group">Amenability</a> but not exponentially 
amenability (solving <strong>Day Problem</strong>).</p>

<p>On the computer science side, some graphs associated with Mealy automata are 
conjectured to by families of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph">expander graphs</a>.</p>

<p>My research involves linking the structure of the automaton and the properties 
of the group it generates. With co-authors we 
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/_media/users/godin/poster_fr.pdf">proved</a> that some shapes 
in the Mealy automaton forbids the group it generates to be infinite~Burnside.</p>
