  <h1 class="post-title">No tiling by convex heptagons</h1>
  <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2018</span>
  <p>Fourth post of the GT CoA series, see 
<a href="https://semidoc.github.io/information-communication">here</a> for the introduction.</p>

<p>The talk related to this post was given by 
<a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/michael.rao/">Michaël Rao</a> on his recent result 
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_tiling">pentagonal tilings</a>. 
This topic has been covered in many places (see for example
<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/pentagon-tiling-proof-solves-century-old-math-problem-20170711/">Quanta magazine</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> 
and this <a href="https://lejournal.cnrs.fr/videos/le-theoreme-du-carreleur">video</a>. 
This post will focus on another aspect: what about heptagonal tilings?
More precisely, how to show that there is no tiling of the plane with a convex 
heptagonal tile?</p>

<p>We first present a simple heurisitic proof that gives the intuition about why this holds, 
and then a more detailed proof. The first one uses simple geometry, the second is 
graph theoretical.</p>

<h1 id="first-heuristic-proof-via-double-counting-of-the-angles">First (heuristic) proof via double-counting of the angles</h1>

<p>Let a <em>contact point</em> be a place where three or more tiles meet. Without loss of 
generality wa can assume that tiles only meet at vertices, that is there is no 
contact point in the interior of an edge, it is always at an endpoint.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon#Angles">sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon</a> 
is $(n-2)\times 180$ degrees, for an heptagon it is $5\times 180=900$ degrees. 
The average degree is $900/7\approx 129$ degrees. Which means that at one 
contact point there are in average $360/129\approx 2.8 $ heptagons meeting. 
This does not make sense because at every contact point there should be at least 
three tiles.</p>

<h1 id="second-proof-with-planar-graphs">Second proof with planar graphs.</h1>

<h2 id="first-attempt-via-the-degree">First attempt via the degree</h2>
<p>Take an infinite tiling, and draw the following graph. In the middle of each 
tile draw a vertex, and between two vertices that represent adjacent tiles, draw 
an edge. This graph is infinite and planar. As the tiles are convex, there are at 
least seven different tiles adjacent to it, and then the minimum degree of a 
vertex in the graph is seven.</p>

<p>If you are used to planar graphs, you may think that this is enough to conclude. 
Indeed, it is known that the average degree of panar graphs is strictly smaller 
than six 
(see for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph#Average_degree">here</a>), 
and the contradiction follows. Actually this is not enough because this average 
degree upper bound holds only in finite graph. As a counter-example to this in 
infinite graphs, consider an infinite regular tree with arbitrary large degree $d$ ; 
it is a planar graph and it has average degree $d$.</p>

<h2 id="euler-formula-on-the-dual">Euler formula on the dual</h2>
<p>The degree bound comes form the classic tool for planar graphs,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic#Plane_graphs">Euler’s formula</a>. 
It states that  $|V|-|E|+|F|=2$ for finite planar graphs, where $V$ is the set of 
nodes, $E$ is the set of edges, and $F$ is the set of faces. The problem 
is that it works only for finite graphs. We will consider a large enough part of 
the infinite graph and use Euler formula to prove the result.</p>

<p>This can probably be achieved in the graph we have defined, but it is more 
convenient on its dual. Given a tiling, consider every place where three 
or more tiles meet as a vertex, and the edges of the tiles are the edges of the 
graph. Basically drawing the tiling is drawing the graph.</p>

<p>Now consider a ball of radius $r$ much larger than the size of the tile, and the 
tiles that are at least partilly in this ball. There 
is order of $r^2$ tiles strictly inside the ball and $O(r)$ tiles at the boundary.
Note that the tiles are the faces of the planar graph (except the outer face 
that is not a tile). A similar thing holds for 
vertices: there are $\Theta(r)$ vertices that are at the boundary, call them 
boundary nodes ($V_b$), and order of  $r^2$ that are strictly inside the graph, 
called interior nodes ($V_i$).</p>

<p>We double-count edges. For every edge, divide it lengthwise into two 
half-edges. There are clearly $2|E|$ half-edges. Also every face except the 
outerface is a tile, so contributes seven half-edges. The number of half-edges 
of the outerface is in $O(r)$. Thus $2|E|=7|F|+O(r)$.</p>

<p>We now count the corners (or interior angles) of tiles. Every tile has seven 
corners, thus this number is exactly $7|F|$. As every interior node contributes 
at least three corners, $7|F|\geq 3|V_i|$.</p>

<p>Now using that $|V|=|V_i|+|V_b|$, then $|E|=\frac{7}{2}|F|+O(r)$ and finally 
$|F|\geq \frac{3}{7}|V_i|$ one gets: $-\frac{15}{14}V_i+V_b-O(r)\geq 2$. This is 
not possible because $V_i$ has a higher order of magnitude than the two other 
terms, thus the asymptotics should go to $-\infty$.</p>

      <p>This would need a proof, but roughly, having a contact point in the middle of an edge only make the argument stronger, as it forces the other angles to be small.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
