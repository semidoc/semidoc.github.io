        Travelling salesman problem on cubic graphs

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2018</span>

    <p>This is the second post of a series that start
<a href="https://semidoc.github.io/information-communication">here</a>, based on the talks 
given at a French meeting on algorithms and complexity 
(<a href="https://www.irif.fr/~nschaban/GT-COA/">GT CoA</a>).</p>

<p>The second talk I want to “review” is: <em>Applications and Constructions of cut-covering 
decompositions for connectivity problems</em>, by 
<a href="http://www.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/membres/newman-alantha--570520.kjsp">Alantha Newman</a> from the 
<a href="http://www.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/welcome--452610.kjsp">GSOP lab</a> in 
Grenoble. Her work is partly based on an approch that began with the paper
 <em><a href="http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/34734/274155.pdf?sequence=1">TSP on Cubic and Subcubic Graphs</a></em>.
What I describe in this post is based on this first paper. You can find more 
advanced lecture notes on this topic, by Newman, 
<a href="http://pagesperso.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/~newmana/Algorithms2017/ORCO-ConvexCombinationsTSP.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_graph">Cubic graphs</a> are graphs in which 
every node has degree 3. These graphs have special structures that are useful 
when designing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm">approximation algorithms</a>
for the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problem</a>
(TSP for short), 
and this is the topic of this post.</p>

<h2 id="from-tsp-to-graph-tsp-and-then-to-graphical-tsp">From TSP to Graph-TSP, and then to graphical-TSP</h2>
<p>First, one may be confused by the fact the TSP is usually defined on weighted
complete graphs, and not on some class of unweighted graphs. Indeed at first it 
does not make sense, as not all the graphs are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path">eulerian</a>, that is, for some graphs 
there does not exist a tour (i.e. a circuit in the graph that visits every 
node exactly once).</p>

<p>We actually deal with <em>graph-TSP</em> here, which is TSP on a subset of instances, whose 
edge weights are very special. Graph-TSP on an unweighted graph $G$ with $n$ nodes, 
means that we are looking for 
the shortest tour in the complete graph $C$ on $n$ nodes, where 
the weight of the edge between two arbitrary nodes $u$ and $v$ in $C$, is the length 
of the shortest path  between these nodes in $G$.
This is known as the metric completion of $G$, and 
indeed one can check that these distances follow the triangle inequality.</p>

<p>Another problem is interesting to us: <em>graphical-TSP</em>. In this new problem, given 
a graph, one has to find the shortest tour that visits all the nodes, 
but with the relaxation that it can visit the nodes and edges more than 
once.</p>

<p>“Graph-TSP” and “Graphical-TSP” are unpleasantly close names, but 
fortunately, the problems are equivalent. Suppose you have a tour for 
graph-TSP, then every edge $(u,v)$ has the weight of the path between $u$ and 
$v$ in $G$: one can take this path instead of the direct edge. 
Unfolding every edge this way, one gets a solution for graphical-TSP with the
same weight. A similar construction works for the other 
direction.</p>

<p>The literature seems to focus on Graph-TSP, probably because it generalizes to 
the classic TSP more easily. For this post, the graphical-TSP is more handy, 
so we continue wih this one.</p>

<h2 id="simplified-christofides-algorithm">Simplified Christofides algorithm</h2>

<p>Consider the following simple approximation algorithm for graphical-TSP. 
Take a minimum 
spanning tree of the graph $G$, and then consider the path taken if one does a 
traversal of this tree. This is a tour (in the sense of graphical-TSP), 
because every node is visited. It gives 
a 2-approximation, because the optimal tour cannot be lighter than the minimum 
spanning tree, and because every edge is taken exactly twice in this solution.
Also it runs in polynomial-time, and that is what we are looking for.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm">Christofides algorithm</a> 
is a refinement of this idea, and it gives a 3/2-approximation for metric 
instance of (the general) TSP. In particular it gives a 3/2-approximation 
for graphical-TSP on cubic graphs and we will show how to get better a better 
ratio.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-graph-theoretic-definitions">A few graph theoretic definitions</h2>
<p>Before we get to why cubic graphs are nice, we need a few definitions from graph theory.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)#Bridgeless_graphs">bridge</a></em> 
in a graph, is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph.</li>
  <li>A <em>perfect matching</em>, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)">matching</a>, 
i.e. a set of vertex-disjoint edges, that matches all vertices in G.</li>
  <li>A <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cycle_cover">(vertex disjoint) cycle cover</a></em>
is a set of vertex-disjoint cycles that spans all vertices in G.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the two last definitions are pretty similar, and indeed they are two 
examples of a more general concept, called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_factorization">$k$-factors</a>. But let’s go 
back to cubic graphs.</p>

<h2 id="cycle-covers-from-petersens-theorem">Cycle covers from Petersen’s theorem</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen%27s_theorem">Petersen’s theorem</a> states 
that every bridgeless cubic graph, has a perfect matching.</p>

<p>Now, take a bridgeless cubic graph and remove a perfect matching. What is 
left? A cycle cover of G. 
Indeed the degree of every node has decreased from three to two, thus the 
resulting graph must be union of cycles spanning all nodes.</p>

<h2 id="all-together-now">All together now</h2>
<p>Let’s put all the ingredients together to get an approximation algorithm for 
graphical-TSP with a better ratio than Christofides algorithm.</p>

<p>First find a cycle cover of $G$ as in the previous section. This can be
done in poynomial time, thanks to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_algorithm">blossom algorithm</a>.
This subgraph is visiting 
every node exactly once, but it is not a tour yet, because it is disconnected. 
We will now 
link these cycles together. Consider 
the graph $G’$ made by contracting every cycle into just one node. On this graph 
$G’$, take the tour
induced by the spanning tree as in the simplified Chritofides algorithm. 
This tour corresponds to a set of edges in $G$. 
Now this set of edges plus the edges of the cycle cover form a tour, and we have 
a solution for graphical-TSP!</p>

<p>What is the weight of this tour? The cycle cover contains exactly $n$ edges. 
Let $c$ be the number of cycles in this cover. Then there are $2c-1$ edges in 
the tree. It follows that the tour has weight $n+2c-1$. With a bit of work<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> one can 
get $c\leq n/6$. This yields to a tour with 
less then $4n/3$ edges. This is a 4/3-approximation, as a tour cannot be shorter 
than $n$, which improves on Christofides.</p>

<p>We discussed only cubic graphs and got only a small improvement here, 
but the approach based on studying the cycle 
covers is fruitful in other context, and led to many improvements for 
this fundamental problem.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-recent-advances-on-asymmetric-tsp">Bonus: recent advances on asymmetric TSP</h2>

<p>On a related topic, there has been recent advances on asymmetric TSP, that is 
TSP where the directed edges $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ do not have the same weight
in general. 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04215">A recent paper</a> gives the  long-awaited
first constant-approximation algorithm for the problem. You will find 
links to a summary and videos on <a href="http://jakub.tarnawski.org/">Jakub Tarnawski’s webpage</a>. 
The paper has been covered on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/09/11/a-tsp-breakthrough/">Gödel’s lost letter</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>,
